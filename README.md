## How To Play/Use


- This app was developed as part of my third Portfolio project with the Code Institute. It is a Tic Tac Toe game developed with Python as its only language and is a Player vs Computer style game that are chosen by the user. The user can then play against a computer that chooses its moves at random, or a computer that maximizes its wins while minimizing its losses. In the end I incorporated the google cloud spreadsheet to show the result of all matches.

- The explanatory video of how the system works:

## Features


Use this section to itemize the features of your project. 

[Below is a brief presentation of how the game works and the integration with Google Spreadsheet Cloud.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79640465/213560562-1e46ee48-1b08-4509-a542-384bfe9ac287.mov)

### Validation Testing
ðŸš¨**Required** 


### Manual Testing

- You will find my manual testing sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/123dAl30RBw5Sq-1GjS7DWu6I563MDM4ZSPRLnatv-ss/edit#gid=0)


### Defect Tracking

![Defects](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79640465/213796712-c17f19b7-83b2-457e-9349-a3b7cbd3bab7.png)




### Outstanding Defects
ðŸš¨**Required** 

It's ok to not resolve all the defects you found as long as:
- it does not impact a user from completing a vital function on the website
- it only affects a very small subset of users
- is an extreme edge case that very few users would try
- there is an open issue against a framework, browser or technology used

If you know of something that isn't quite right, create an issue and link to it here and explain why you chose not to resolve it. 

Sometimes it's as simple, word wrapping issue that makes the site look odd at a certain screensize that you just didn't have time to fix due to the impending deadline it's best to mention it but note why you allowed it to go live: "Yes it looks odd, but it doesn't impact core functionality of the site." than to let the accessors think you didn't notice it. 

### Commenting Code

        value = [self.username, self.currentPlayer, lista, self.winner]
        return value

    def playerinput(self):
        """"

        """""

### Acknowledgments

I would like to thank all the knowledge that was acquired and make a comment, I had a lot of difficulty in finishing this project, I found the classes confusing, I had to look for another type of help to understand. I had a serious problem on my machine where once again github was not pushing.

I would like to thank my mentor Malia who was very patient in explaining things to me more clearly.

Andre Maurilho helped me configure my computer so that github would work, and even uploaded a file that was stuck in my repository.

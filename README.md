# OVERVIEW

This template was made as a guide to ensure you cover assessment criteria in your third milestone write up. It is specific to the **PORTFOLIO 3: Python Essentials** project. It was based off the [battleship readme](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/CSSEssentials/p3-readme.png) with a few additions to help elevate you to possible distinction status.


Sections marked as ðŸš¨**Required**  and ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

**Please note** that project assessment criteria changes more often than these guides are updated so double-check the submission criteria before assuming the  ðŸš¨**Required**  is all you have to do to pass.

## Helpful tools

### Debugging Your run.py in gitpod
With a single file importing others, gitpod lets you set breakpoints where you then can look at variables and try out syntax.

### Screenshots and Videos
**Hereâ€™s a great video on how to add videos to your readme! no need to convert to gifs!!**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3Cytlicv8Y

> 1. record a video via slack
> 2. download it
> 3. in github, edit your readme via the pencil icon
> 4. type a place holder word and highlight it
> 5. drag and drop mp4 file over that text
> 6. scroll down to the commit area
> 7. update the default commit message
> 8. click the green button
> 9. ```git pull``` changes to your gitpod workspace

**You can do the steps 3-9 for the image/screenshot uploads too!**

### Cheatsheets and Auto Generation Tools

Markdown's not all that easy so sometimes you may want to use some tools to make tables. 

- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [markdown table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) - used to help with documentation table formatting
- [mardown table of contents generator](https://luciopaiva.com/markdown-toc/) - used to create table of contents (be weary it does have some bugs if you have dashes or trailing spaces in your headers)
- [readme.so](https://readme.so/) - if you don't want to learn markdown, this tool might help you

# Table of Contents
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

Copy your readme to https://luciopaiva.com/markdown-toc/ to make a table of contents.  This will help assessors to see the structure of your readme. Just test it out ast this tool isn't perfect. It tends to mess up with special characters like dashes.

## How To Play/Use


- This app was developed as part of my third Portfolio project with the Code Institute. It is a Tic Tac Toe game developed with Python as its only language and is a Player vs Computer style game that are chosen by the user. The user can then play against a computer that chooses its moves at random, or a computer that maximizes its wins while minimizing its losses. In the end I incorporated the google cloud spreadsheet to show the result of all matches.

- The explanatory video of how the system works:

## Features


Use this section to itemize the features of your project. 

[Below is a brief presentation of how the game works and the integration with Google Spreadsheet Cloud.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79640465/213560562-1e46ee48-1b08-4509-a542-384bfe9ac287.mov)

## Testing

![Code TicTacToe Game ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79640465/213772339-fcf76435-aa51-470a-9c87-ab779ae7a6cc.png)

![Code TicTacToe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79640465/213772365-5361c014-4701-478b-a291-175716ac6e78.png)

![Code run](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79640465/213772396-52bfb2bf-b23b-4901-9194-ad207c3ee4cf.png)

### Validation Testing
ðŸš¨**Required** 

You should try to ensure you code is valid and follows proper indentation.  In this section you should write up any websites you used to validate your code. As your projects becomes more complex these tools may change.

For each python file in your project, paste it into [CI's pep8 tool](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/), and take a screenshot of the linter output showing NO ERRORS

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/212106175-36b2f18a-7c75-458d-94dd-9886e81c71f3.png)

Ideally you would have no errors remaining outside of line too long which you can fix by 

adding
```$python 
# noqa
```
There is a space before the # and after it to skip the quality assurance for that line.

Note any errors or warnings you are ignoring and why.

### Manual Testing


### Manual Testing

- You will find my manual testing sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/123dAl30RBw5Sq-1GjS7DWu6I563MDM4ZSPRLnatv-ss/edit#gid=0)

### Defect Tracking

- You will find my defect tracking sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xYKKoZuA54QKtIxZ2fA6-BUdHOFavs1R6JX9CK3YZQM/edit?usp=sharing).

### Defect Tracking

![Defects](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79640465/213796712-c17f19b7-83b2-457e-9349-a3b7cbd3bab7.png)




### Outstanding Defects
ðŸš¨**Required** 

It's ok to not resolve all the defects you found as long as:
- it does not impact a user from completing a vital function on the website
- it only affects a very small subset of users
- is an extreme edge case that very few users would try
- there is an open issue against a framework, browser or technology used

If you know of something that isn't quite right, create an issue and link to it here and explain why you chose not to resolve it. 

Sometimes it's as simple, word wrapping issue that makes the site look odd at a certain screensize that you just didn't have time to fix due to the impending deadline it's best to mention it but note why you allowed it to go live: "Yes it looks odd, but it doesn't impact core functionality of the site." than to let the accessors think you didn't notice it. 

### Commenting Code
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

Make sure you use triple double quotes to document functions and classes.
 Here'a  documentation worthy example:
```$python
def yes_no(question):
    """
    Function to ask a simple yes no question of the user.
    :param question: String displayed as the question
    :return: answer: String equal to "1" or "2" representing yes or no respectfully
    """
    print(question)
    print("yes = 1")
    print("no = 2")
    answer = input("enter your answer here \n").strip()
    while answer not in ("1", "2"):
        print("please choose 1 for yes and 2 for no")
        answer = input("enter your answer here \n").strip()
    return answer

```

3. The downloaded credentialsJSON file is basically your creds.json file that you need to put into your heroku settings or gitpod environment to access your google drive.

4. Google Sheet Template
  - If you had to create specific sheets for your project, instruct users to make their own copy of it from yours and rename it back to what the python project expects
  - And don't forget to share the spreadsheet in question with the client_email from the creds.json 

### Gitpod
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

This section should describe the process someone would have to go through to get the local working in gitpod.  Such as install requirements.txt  and setting up a creds.json file that is in the gitignore and keeping their workspace.

If you have project settings required such as a creds.json file from the GOOGLE DRIVE API acess, please provide an example of that file in the writeup with the project key values:

### Acknowledgments

I would like to thank all the knowledge that was acquired and make a comment, I had a lot of difficulty in finishing this project, I found the classes confusing, I had to look for another type of help to understand. I had a serious problem on my machine where once again github was not pushing.

I would like to thank my mentor Malia who was very patient in explaining things to me more clearly.

Andre Maurilho helped me configure my computer so that github would work, and even uploaded a file that was stuck in my repository.
